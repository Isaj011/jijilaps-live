    name: "Arturo’s Restaurant, Italian",
    info:
      "Adjacent to a crocodile farm, Arturo’s makes it surprisingly easy to immerse yourself in the ambiance of the chic restaurant space and forget your scaly neighbors. Known to have been described by Italian expats as not only the best Italian restaurant in the whole of Kenya, but the best Italian restaurant outside of Italy, Arturo’s menu offers a slice of Europe in the heart of Africa. The menu veers away from a focus on pizza and pasta, replicating other regional delicacies such as carpaccio, minestrone and large, flavorsome salads. That said, if you crave an expertly prepared, crispy based margarita with plenty of creamy mozzarella and a rich tomato sauce, Arturo’s is the place to be."

    info:
      "Talisman is widely considered to be one of the best restaurants in Kenya — for good reason. The elegant gastro-lounge serves a fusion of European, Pan-Asian, and African cuisine; quality and service are consistently great. Try the warm feta and coriander samosas served with a chili ginger jam, or the grilled filet with bhajia potatoes (a potato patty mixed with vegetables and deep fried) and a spicy wasabi-mustard sauce"

    info:
      "Kenyans have quickly come to love Mama Ashanti, a restaurant that serves West African food, specializing in Ghanaian recipes. West African cuisine is known for its spice and caters best to those who can handle lots of chili. Favorites include egusi (fish), pepe (a fiery goat soup), and plantains (both spiced and non-spiced)."
